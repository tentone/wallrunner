# Wallrunner
 - Wallrunner platformer game repository, developed as a first mobile project.
 - Super meat boy like game mechanics (running, wall jumping, etc).
 - Built with Java and LibGDX and supports multiplatforms (Android, Desktop, iOS).
 - Has a level editor to create levels for the game.
 - Support for vectorial animations using the Ganimator framework (made as a separate project)
 - Custom made physics engine with support for AABB.
 - Background layers with support for parallax movement.
 - Sprite based particle emitting system (software).
